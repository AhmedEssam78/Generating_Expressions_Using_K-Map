# Generating_Expressions_Using_K-Map
A computer program in C++ will be developed to accomplish the following tasks: 
1. Read in (and validate) a Boolean function using its minterms as decimal 
numbers. 
2. Generate and print the corresponding K-map. 
3. Generate and print the simplified Boolean expression.
